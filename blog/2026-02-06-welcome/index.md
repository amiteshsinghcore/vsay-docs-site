We are thrilled to introduce **VSAY Terminal** — a full-fledged **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** solution.

## Our Story

VSAY Terminal started as one of a idea of Amitesh that why now we make the thing simple and secure in today's world where everything is simply accessible — Then we formed a team with Yesveer, Rishabh and Amitesh where the vision was to simplify how teams manage privileged access to their servers. What began as an idea during countless hours of juggling SSH keys, remembering IP addresses, and managing team permissions, eventually became a mission. Then, together they designed and developed what VSAY Terminal is today. The three engineers shared a common frustration: managing SSH connections and privileged access across multiple servers shouldn't be this complicated. There had to be a better way.

And so, VSAY Terminal was born — a secure, intuitive, and powerful PAM platform that makes privileged access management effortless for teams of all sizes.

Special Thanks to Yesveer Singh who has given his whole effort to make this dream come true.

## What Makes Us Different?

Unlike traditional PAM solutions, VSAY Terminal is built with developer experience at its core. We don't just provide a web portal — we bring privileged access management directly into your workflow:

### Multi-Channel Accessibility

| **VSAY VSCode Extension** | Manage and connect to servers directly from your IDE |
| **VSAY Shell CLI** | Command-line tool for automation and scripting |
| **Agent-Based Access** | Deploy agents for seamless, secure connections |

### Enterprise-Grade Security

- **External Authentication** — Integrate with your existing identity provider using Keycloak for OIDC/SSO
